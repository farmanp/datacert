# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains records of significant architectural decisions made during the development of DataCert.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Format

ADRs should follow a consistent format, typically including:

1.  **Title**: Short and descriptive.
2.  **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded.
3.  **Context**: What is the problem we are trying to solve? What are the constraints?
4.  **Decision**: What is the chosen solution?
5.  **Consequences**: What are the pros and cons of this decision? What are the trade-offs?
