# Hybrid Scoring Rubric for AI-Ready Tickets
# Used to evaluate ticket quality. Target Score: 10+

scoring:
  max_score: 16
  min_to_execute: 10
  critical_dimensions:
    - intent_clarity
    - context_constraints
    - acceptance_criteria

dimensions:
  intent_clarity:
    weight: critical
    score_0: "No clear goal or outcome."
    score_1: "Goal stated but vague."
    score_2: "Clear user/system intent and value (User Story + Success Statement)."

  context_constraints:
    weight: critical
    score_0: "No context or constraints."
    score_1: "Partial context, assumptions unclear."
    score_2: "Scope, assumptions, and constraints explicit (In/Out of scope defined)."

  acceptance_criteria:
    weight: critical
    score_0: "No acceptance criteria."
    score_1: "Criteria exist but are vague."
    score_2: "Clear, testable behavior (Gherkin preferred for Stories/Bugs)."

  execution_readiness:
    weight: standard
    score_0: "Missing inputs or dependencies."
    score_1: "Minor unanswered questions."
    score_2: "Fully actionable as written."

  decision_encoding:
    weight: standard
    score_0: "No planned commit message."
    score_1: "Commit exists but vague or non-standard."
    score_2: "Clear, conventional, outcome-focused commit message."

  verification_criteria:
    weight: standard
    score_0: "No definition of done."
    score_1: "Partial or implicit DoD."
    score_2: "Explicit verification checklist."

  scope_size:
    weight: standard
    score_0: "Too large or unclear scope."
    score_1: "Slightly oversized."
    score_2: "Single, focused outcome."

  resource_linking:
    weight: standard
    score_0: "No resources."
    score_1: "Some links, missing key info."
    score_2: "All relevant resources linked."

enforcement:
  block:
    - "Any 'critical' dimension scores 0"
    - "Total score < 10"
    - "Acceptance criteria are not testable"
  coach:
    - "Total score 8-9"
    - "No critical failures, but ambiguity exists"
  proceed:
    - "Total score >= 10"
    - "All critical dimensions score >= 1"
