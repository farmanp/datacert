## 📈 Growth Strategy: "The Data Quality Swiss Army Knife"

Our mission is to make data profiling as ubiquitous as `ls` or `grep`.

### 1. The Hooks
- **"Private by Design":** We don't want your data. In an era of data leaks, DataCert is the only tool your compliance officer will approve instantly.
- **Instant Gratification:** From CSV to Profile in < 2 seconds. No login required.

### 2. Community Engagement
- **Show HN & Reddit:** Targetting `r/dataengineering` with the Rust-technical edge.
- **PLG Viral Loop:** Exportable HTML reports allow teams to share quality audits without sharing raw data access.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Web UI
1. Visit the hosted version (PWA supported).
2. Drag and drop any `.csv`, `.json`, `.parquet`, or `.xlsx` file.
3. Review your data health instantly.

### CLI Usage
For automated quality gates in CI/CD:

```bash
npx datacert profile data.csv --fail-on-missing 5
```
*See the [CLI Guide](docs/guides/cli.md) for more.*
